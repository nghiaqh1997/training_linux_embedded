Agenda
Introduction
	Can extend kernel code when needed
	Interact with kernel to become only one kernel process
	Code instruction has same priority with kernel
Setup environment for development
Hardware
	Board
		Pi
			Good support from community
			Poor hardware document
		Udoo
			Good hardware document
			Should use Udoo for development
Firmware
	Download firmware from main page
		https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
	Install firmware
		Install Window's tool to write firmware for sdcard
			https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md
	Plug in sdcard, power cable, mouse, keyboard and monitor for Pi
Connect PC with board
	Install MobaXterm for PC
		https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/
	Setup network to connect Pi with PC
		Set static IP for Pi and PC
	Install ssh tool for Pi
	Create new session in MobaXterm to ssh with Pi
Install kernel header in Pi
	It include all source header need to develop kernel module
	It is generate when they build kernel image
	Each kernel instance has only one kernel header
	sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers
Create Hello world kernel module
Source code
Make file
Load and test result
Home work
